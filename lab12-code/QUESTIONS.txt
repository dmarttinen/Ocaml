Answer the questions below according to the lab specification. Write
your answers directly in this text file and submit it to complete the
lab.


Files `buggy_lpe.ml' and `lpe_main.ml'
======================================

  This lab deals with a lexer, parser, evaluator system for a small
  language that includes arithmetic, `let/in' expressions, and
  `if/then/else' expressions. `lex_parse_eval.ml' is primarily
  responsible for this and is divided into 4 sections that handle a
  simple arithmetic language with some more programmatic elements. The 4
  sections are:
  1. Lexer: which converts a character string into a list of tokens.
  2. Parser: which converts a list of tokens into an expression tree,
     often referred to as a Parse Tree or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
  3. Evaluator: which analyzes the expression tree and computes a
     numeric result.
  4. To-string functions: which are used to convert token lists and
     parse trees to strings that can be printed.

  The functions in `lex_parse_eval.ml' are used in the file
  `lpe_main.ml' which takes an expression from the command line and
  performs lexing, parsing, and evaluation on it.  Here are some
  examples though the examples for `if/then/else' won't work until the
  lab is completed.

PROBLEM 1: Debugger Basics
==========================

(A)
~~~

  Compile the two source files together to create an executable. Make
  sure that debug information is turned on via the `-g' switch as in
  ,----
  | > ocamlc -g buggy_lpe.ml lpe_main.ml
  | File "buggy_lpe.ml", line 249, characters 5-42:
  | Warning 10: this expression should have type unit.
  `----

  Note that the warning shown is likely to be shown and will be
  addressed later in the lab.

  Run the program as shown which should generate an exception.
  ,----
  | ./a.out 'let x=5 in x+2'
  `----

  Show the results of this exception in the terminal which should be a
  bit perplexing.

  While it might be possible to diagnose the problem simply by examining
  the source code carefully, the remainder of this problem will
  demonstrate how to use the debugger to gather information that can
  lead to a fix.

  Parse Tree:
  Fatal error: exception Buggy_lpe.ParseError("syntax error", _)

(B)
~~~

  Start the debugger with the compiled program as in:
  ,----
  | > ocamldebug a.out
  | 	OCaml Debugger version 4.xx
  |
  | (ocd)
  `----

  Since the `lpe_main.ml' program must take command line arguments, set
  them using the `set arguments <args>' command as in
  ,----
  | (ocd) set arguments 'let x=5 in x+2'
  `----

  Run the program with the `run' command and copy the results below.
  (ocd) run
  Loading program... done.
  Tokens:
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  Time: 2367
  Program end.
  Uncaught exception: Buggy_lpe.ParseError ("syntax error", _)

(C)
~~~

  A major strength of OCaml's debugger is it enables so-called
  "time-traveling" allowing both forward and backward steps. A standard
  debugger such as is widely available in C and Java allows only forward
  steps, not backwards.  The technique that enables ocamldebug this is
  not conceptually not difficult: it simply saves program state
  occasionally as a 'checkpoint' and when one requests backwards
  movement, the program position is noted and the program is restarted
  from the latest checkpoint to the desired moment in time.

  As an end user, this means on hitting an uncaught excepton, one can
  simply back up a step to see what is happening using the `backstep'
  command. Moving forward is a matter of issuing a `step' command. Do
  some backsteps and steps after hitting the exception from the last
  part. Paste the results below.
  (ocd) backstep
  Tokens:
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  Time: 2366 - pc: 137732 - module Buggy_lpe
  178   | _ -> raise (ParseError {msg="syntax error"; toks=toks})<|a|>
  (ocd) backstep
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  Time: 2365 - pc: 137708 - module Buggy_lpe
  178   | _ -> <|b|>raise (ParseError {msg="syntax error"; toks=toks})
  (ocd) backstep
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  Time: 2364 - pc: 137616 - module Buggy_lpe
  167   <|b|>match toks with
  (ocd) step
  Time: 2365 - pc: 137708 - module Buggy_lpe
  178   | _ -> <|b|>raise (ParseError {msg="syntax error"; toks=toks})
  (ocd)

(E)
~~~

  Next set some *breakpoints* at functions of interest which will stop
  the debugger from executing when reached. If an uncaught exception has
  been hit, all of the modules associated with program are already
  loaded one can use the name of the function to set the breakpoint as
  in:
  ,----
  | (ocd) break Buggy_lpe.parse_muldiv
  | Breakpoint 1 at 145252: file buggy_lpe.ml, line 137, characters 3-348
  `----
  Follow this with the `reverse' command which will run the program in
  "reverse" until the break point is hit. After hitting it, run the
  `list' and `backtrace' commands and paste the results below.
  (ocd) list
  127     | Minus :: rest ->                          (* found - *)
  128        let (rexpr,rest) = parse_letin rest in   (* consume a higher-prec expression *)
  129        iter (Sub(lexpr,rexpr)) rest             (* create a  Sub tree and iterate again *)
  130     | _ -> (lexpr, toks)
  131   in
  132   let (lexpr, rest) = parse_muldiv toks in      (* create the initial left expression *)
  133   iter lexpr rest                               (* start iterating *)
  134
  135 (* parse multiplication and division, same principle as parse_addsub *)
  136 and parse_muldiv toks =
  137   <|b|>let rec iter lexpr toks =
  138     match toks with
  139     | Times :: rest ->
  140        let (rexpr,rest) = parse_ident rest in
  141        iter (Mul(lexpr,rexpr)) rest
  142     | Slash :: rest ->
  143        let (rexpr,rest) = parse_ident rest in
  144        iter (Div(lexpr,rexpr)) rest
  145     | _ -> (lexpr, toks)
  146   in
  147   let (lexpr, rest) = parse_ident toks in
  (ocd) backtrace
  Backtrace:
  #0 Buggy_lpe buggy_lpe.ml:137:3
  #1 Buggy_lpe buggy_lpe.ml:132:40
  #2 Buggy_lpe buggy_lpe.ml:115:32
  #3 Lpe_main lpe_main.ml:30:39

Breakpoints from the beginning of Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  When running from the beginning of a program, not all modules are
  loaded so functions may not be identifiable by name. In this case,
  breakpoints at specific source lines like the below where 136 is the
  source line corresponding to the `parse_muldiv' function.
  ,----
  | (ocd) break @ Buggy_lpe 136
  | Loading program... done.
  | Breakpoint 1 at 145252: file buggy_lpe.ml, line 137, characters 3-348
  `----


PROBLEM 2: Debugging the Program
================================

(A)
~~~

  After positioning the debugger as indicated above, print the `toks'
  variable then use the `step' command to step through the execution of
  `parse_muldiv'.

  - What token is at the front of the token list?
    Let
  - Does the control flow seem to make sense for parsing a the tokens at
    the beginning of the token list?
    Yes
  - After examining the source code, is the function call sequence
    appropriate or should changes be made?
    parse_muldiv default case should go to parse_letin not parse_ident
  - Describe the bug that is in the source code and how to fix it.
    replace the parse_ident call in parse_muldiv with a call to parse_letin

(B)
~~~

  After identifying the bug in the parser, make a change to fix it. Quit
  the debugger (via `quit'), recompile, re-run the program on the
  problem input to show some progress has been made. Paste your results
  below and state how the results differ.
  Tokens:
  [Let; Ident(x); Equal; Int(5); In; Ident(x); Plus; Int(2)]

  Parse Tree:
  Letin( x )
    .var_expr:
      IConst(5)
    .in_expr:
      Add
        Varname(x)
        IConst(2)

  Result:
  Fatal error: exception Buggy_lpe.EvalError("No variable 'x' bound")

  Different error this time. The prase tree has data in it

(C)
~~~

  Start the debugger again, set the arguments, and run to the uncaught
  exception. Backstep and then use `list' to show the source position.

  The trouble at this point should be apparent: something is wrong with
  the `varmap'.  Unfortunately, the debugger is not equipped to print
  standard Maps as evidenced by failed attempt to print:
  ,----
  | > ocamldebug a.out
  |
  | (ocd) set arguments 'let x=5 in x+2'
  | (ocd) run
  | Uncaught exception: Buggy_lpe.EvalError "No variable 'x' bound"
  |
  | (ocd) backstep
  |
  | (ocd) print varmap
  | varmap: varval_t Varmap.t = <abstr>
  `----

  This output is hidden behind an abstraction barrier. One can install
  "printers" which will display data for maps and other more customized
  types but this is beyond the scope of the lab.

  Rather, turn your attention to the warning that has been issued on
  every compilation.  Examine the associated code and describe what is
  being done wrong.
  varmap.add returns a new map, it doesn't update the current map since the map is immutable

(D)
~~~

  Fix the evaluation error, recompile, and show that the trouble code
  now evaluates correctly. Show your corrected lines of code in
  `buggy_lpe.ml' and the results of running on the input.

Optional Extras
===============

  IDENTICAL TO LAB 11

  Currently the lexer/parser/evaluator does not handle numeric
  comparisons to produce boolean results such as
  ,----
  | 5 < 2 -> Bool false
  | if 1+2 > 0 then 8 else 4  -> Int 8
  `----
  This will be a required part of the final assignment interpreter so it
  would be an excellent exercise to extend the system to handle these
  new expression types.

  - Extend the lexer to include < and >. The = sign is already part of
    the lexer.
  - Extend the expression type to include comparison expressions for
    Less, Greater, Equal with constituent left/right expressions (like
    arithmetic).
  - Extend the parser functions with a new function to parse
    comparisons. This should occur at a lower precedence than
    arithmetic.
  - Extend the evaluator to include evaluation cases for
    comparisons. These should check that their left/right expressions
    are integers, do the appropriate comparison on the numbers, and
    return a Bool.  You may wish to model them after the arithmetic
    evaluation code.
