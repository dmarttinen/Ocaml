PROBLEM 1: Pairs and Association Lists
======================================

  Tuples allow multiple data of different types to be stored
  together. OCaml allows arbitrarily large tuples but in practice one
  works mostly with pairs (2-tuples) and triples (3-tuples).

  This problem explores *Association List* to map keys to values; these
  make extensive use of pairs (2-tuples). They are simple means of
  implementing the idea of a "map" from keys to values. In many
  functional programming contexts, the are implemented simply as an
  unordered list of pairs. This gives them linear complexity for
  operations like lookup. For small collections of key/values this is
  reasonable but as the collection goes large, one typically switches to
  using a sorted tree (logarithmic operations) or hash tables (amortized
  constant operations).


(A)
~~~

  Examine the first function in `assoc_lists.ml' which is called
  `assoc'.  It operates on a key and an association list like the two
  provided as `alist1' and `alist2'.

  ,----
  | let rec assoc query_key alist =
  |   match alist with
  |   | [] -> raise Not_found
  |   | (key,value)::tail when query_key=key -> value
  |   | _::tail -> assoc query_key tail
  | ;;
  |
  | let alist1 = [(9,"nine");   (5,"five");    (2,"two");]
  | let alist2 = [("nine",3.0); ("five",2.24); ("two",1.41); ("six",2.45)];;
  `----

  In a REPL, load this code and run the function on the following
  inputs.
  - 9 and alist1
  - 2 and alist1
  - 7 and alist1
  - "six" and alist2
  - "one" and alist2
  - 1 and alist2

  Show your results below and explain what the function is doing. Also
  explain any errors for the above inputs and why the are happening.
	# assoc 9 alist1;;
	- : string = "nine"
	# assoc 2 alist1;;
	- : string = "two"
	# assoc 7 alist1;;
	Exception: Not_found.
	# assoc "six" alist2;;
	- : float = 2.45
	# assoc "one" alist2;;
	Exception: Not_found.
	# assoc 1 alist2;;
	Error: This expression has type (string * float) list
	       but an expression was expected of type (int * 'a) list
	       Type string is not compatible with type int


assoc is returning the value associated with the query_key
It returns not found if the query_key doesn't exist in the list.
It returns an error if the query_key is of a different type than any of the keys in the list.

(B)
~~~

  Examine the provided function `add_assoc' which adds an key/val pair
  to an association list if the key is not present or modifies the value
  associated with an existing key.

  ,----
  | 1  (* return a list with the given key/value added; if the key already
  | 2     exists, changes association to the new value *)
  | 3  let rec add_assoc key value alist =
  | 4    match alist with
  | 5    | [] -> (key,value)::[]
  | 6    | (k,v) :: tail when key=k -> (key,value)::tail
  | 7    | (k,v) :: tail -> (k,v) :: (add_assoc key value tail)
  | 8  ;;
  `----


  You may wish to run this function on some inputs like
  ,----
  | # add_assoc 7 "seven" alist1;;
  `----
  to get acquainted with its operation.

  Describe how this function works. Include the following in your
  answer.
  - Identify each case in the match/with statement as either a base case
    or a recursive case.
  - What situations does each case of the pattern matching expression
    handle?
  - How is pattern matching used to handle pairs in the list?
add_assoc adds a new int to string association at the end of the association list
If the list is empty create an associatoin and add it to the empty list. This is the base case.
if the key already exists add a new association with the key and the new value, replacing the original value
otherwise pop off the head pair from the list and recursively call add_assoc with the new pair and the tail of the list


(C)
~~~

  At the bottom of `assoc_lists.ml' is a commented declaration for the
  `remove_assoc key alist' function.  As the comment indicates, this
  should remove any existing association from a given list.

  ,----
  | 1  (* return a list with the given key and associated value removed; if
  | 2     the given key is not present, no change is made to the list. Does
  | 3     not raise exceptions. *)
  | 4  (* let rec remove_assoc key alist =  *)
  `----

  Complete this function. Use a similar code structure that that which
  is used in `add_assoc'. Demonstrate that the function works correctly
  in a REPL by removing some associations from `alist1' and `alist2'
	# let rec remove_assoc key alist =
	  match alist w  ith
	    | [] ->   []
	    | (k,v) :  : tail when key = k -> tail
	      | (k,v) :: tail -> (k,v) :: (remove_assoc key tail)
	;;
	val remove_assoc : 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a * 'b) list = <fun>
	# remove_assoc 9 alist1;;
	- : (int * string) list = [(5, "five"); (2, "two")]
	# remove_assoc "two" alist2;;
	- : (string * float) list = [("nine", 3.); ("five", 2.24); ("six", 2.45)]


Note: Built-in Association Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  OCaml has functions operating on Association Lists built in. They are
  available in the `List' module and can be called as follows.
  ,----
  | # let alist = [(9, "nine"); (5, "five"); (2, "two")];;
  | val alist : (int * string) list = [(9, "nine"); (5, "five"); (2, "two")]
  |
  | # List.assoc 2 alist;;
  | - : string = "two"
  |
  | # List.assoc 6 alist;;
  | Exception: Not_found.
  |
  | # List.remove_assoc 5 alist;;
  | - : (int * string) list = [(9, "nine"); (2, "two")]
  `----

  More details are in the module documentation for list here:
  [https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html#1_Associationlists]

  Note that the semantics for standard association lists are somewhat
  different than those we implemented here: keys may be duplicated and
  "left-most" bindings are returned. This makes adding on more efficient
  at the expense of memory and removal complexity.


PROBLEM 2: Records
==================

  Records are types defined to have multiple named *fields* of different
  kinds. These are similar to C's structs and Java's objects. This
  problem explores basic record definition and use.


(A)
~~~

  Examine the provided source file `record_use.ml'. The first few lines
  of this file contain a type declaration for a new record type called
  `force_user'.

  ,----
  | 1  (* record type declaration *)
  | 2  type force_user = {
  | 3      name     : string;          (* field 1 *)
  | 4      darkside : bool;            (* field 2 *)
  | 5      episodes : int list;        (* field 3 *)
  | 6    };;
  `----

  Below it are several examples of creating `force_user' records.  Make
  use of this pattern to declare some additional `force_user' records
  and paste your new code below. Demonstrate that your code works
  properly by loading it in a REPL.
	let vader = {
	  name="Anakin Skywalker";
	  darkside=true;
	  episodes=[4;5;6]
	};;

	let obiwan = {
	  name="Obi Wan Kenobi";
	  darkside=false;
	  episodes=[1;2;3;4]
	};;

	# let vader = {
    name="Anakin Skywalker";
  darks  ide=true;
  epis  odes=[4;5;6]
}

      let obiwan = {
    name="Obi Wan Kenobi";
  darksi  de=false;
  epis  odes=[1;2;3;4]
}
  ;;
val vader : force_user =
  {name = "Anakin Skywalker"; darkside = true; episodes = [4; 5; 6]}
val obiwan : force_user =
  {name = "Obi Wan Kenobi"; darkside = false; episodes = [1; 2; 3; 4]}

(B)
~~~

  Record fields are accessed with dot notation. This can be done in
  individual statements or during execution of functions. The following
  code segments from `record_use.ml' show some examples.

  ,----
  |  1  (* field access *)
  |  2  let last_jedi1 = luke.name;;
  |  3  let last_jedi2 = rey.name;;
  |  4  let sith_reigh = List.length sidious.episodes;;
  |  5
  |  6  (* functions on records *)
  |  7  let name_of user =              (* retrieve the name *)
  |  8    user.name
  |  9  ;;
  | 10
  | 11  let episode_count user =        (* count episodes *)
  | 12    List.length user.episodes
  | 13  ;;
  `----

  Demonstrate in a REPL some field accesses on the data you have defined
  like
  - Accessing the darkside field
  - Measuring the length of a name field with String.length
  - Appending two episode field lists with @ (append) operator
	# String.length vader.name;;
	- : int = 16
	# obiwan.darkside;;
	- : bool = false
	# obiwan.episodes @ vader.episodes;;
	- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 4; 5; 6]

(C)
~~~

  Consider the function `seduced': it takes a `force_user' as an
  argument and creates a new version of it using the `with' syntax.
  ,----
  | 1  let seduced user =              (* new record with field changed *)
  | 2    let dark_user = {user with darkside=true} in
  | 3    dark_user
  | 4  ;;
  `----

  Use a REPL to demonstrate how `seduced' works.  Determine whether this
  function actually changes the original record or not. Explain your
  answer.
	# seduced obiwan;;
	- : force_user =
	{name = "Obi Wan Kenobi"; darkside = true; episodes = [1; 2; 3; 4]}

	This function creates a new record with the darkside value changed, but it doesn't change the original record.
	It creates a new record dark_user with the values from the original and modifies that.


(D)
~~~

  Write a function `sequel_appearance'. It takes a `force_user' and an
  integer as parameters. It creates a new `force_user' record from the
  old one with the integer parameter appended to the end of the
  `episodes' field using the @ operator.  Its type and use are
  demonstrated below.
  ,----
  | # #use "record_use.ml";;
  | val sequel_appearance : force_user -> int -> force_user = <fun>
  |
  | # rey;;
  | - : force_user = {name = "Rey"; darkside = false; episodes = [7; 8]}
  | # sequel_appearance rey 9;;
  | - : force_user = {name = "Rey"; darkside = false; episodes = [7; 8; 9]}
  |
  | # vader;;
  | - : force_user =
  | {name = "Anakin Skywalker"; darkside = true; episodes = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]}
  | # sequel_appearance vader 10;;
  | - : force_user =
  | {name = "Anakin Skywalker"; darkside = true; episodes = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 10]}
  `----

	let sequel_appearance user episode_num =
	  let sequel_user = {user with episodes = (user.episodes @ episode_num::[])} in
	  sequel_user
	;;
